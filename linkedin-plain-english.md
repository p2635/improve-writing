# Interesting Quotes
"Daniel Oppenheimer, a psychologist at Princeton University experimented with easy-to-understand versus more complex versions of writing, in which easy-to-understand words were replaced with more impressive sounding words. Such as changing angry to splenetic. His study concluded that the more grandiose and complex the language used the less intelligent the writer was rated. In other words, using big words made the writer look less educated. The number two mistake in Dawn Josephson's article, The Top 3 Business Writing Mistakes You’re Probably Making Right Now, is writing to impress rather than to express."
