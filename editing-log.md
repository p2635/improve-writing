# Editing Log

This is a log of articles I've edited to practice Plain Language.

Goals:

* 1-2 sentences each day is good.
* Use guidelines such as https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines
* If I edit purely based on intuition, I will try to explain why I did changed things.
* If I can't explain what I did, I can reverse engineer what I did based on guidelines like the above.

- Title: Application life cycle in iOS
- Source: https://manasaprema04.medium.com/application-life-cycle-in-ios-f7365d8c1636
- Date Edited: 2 Feb 2023

**The application life cycle constitutes the sequence of events that occurs between the launch and termination of application.**

My edits: "The application lifecycle describes everything that happens from app (or application) launch to termination."

My thought process:

- ‘Constitute’ has been replaced with plain language.
- ’Sequence of events’ is not conversational.
- I’m not sure what to use instead of ‘termination’ but it’s not conversational.
- ‘Lifecycle’ is more common so I’ve used this instead (but ‘life cycle’ is not wrong).

**Steps involved from device reboot to app launch:-**

- **When user turn on the phone, no applications are running except app which belong to OS.When user tap on your app icon, SpringBoard launches your app.****

My edits:

“iOS application life cycle:

1. iOS device is completely switched off
2. User turns on the iOS device 
3. No applications are running except OS-level applications
4. User taps on your app and SpringBoard launches”

My thought process:

- The title of the list is confusing ‘Steps involved from device reboot to app launch’. I would simply call it ‘iOS application life cycle:’ and move the device reboot/app launch below it.
- The list is unordered (bullets) but an ordered (numbered) list should be used - it’s a sequence of events.
- ‘Turn on’ should be ‘turns on’.
- One or event action per point, this improves readability.
